I am a Health Policy PhD candidate at UC Berkeley with a specialization in Population Health and Data Science. My research focuses on improving health for people involved in the United States carceral system through decarceration efforts, addressing human rights concerns, and improved medical care. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a programmer analyst on cost-effectiveness and simulation modeling studies focused on hepatitis C elimination and overdose reduction. I have an MPH in Health Policy from the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University and a BS in Anthropology from Portland State University.
